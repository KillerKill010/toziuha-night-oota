Free Metroidvania inspired on Castlevania Order of Ecclesia

This is a free opensource metroidvania inspired by Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.
This game still is on development. Please try the game and search bugs or make me feature requests :D

The idea is to provide a game with not so long maps with some backtracking (like order of ecclesia), open source and free, programmed in a way that even people without programming knowledge can create levels to be played (something like mario maker) and available for Android, Windows, Linux and MacOS. I have a developer account on playstore and have already published games there, so no, I'm not doing this as a hobby, I'm willing to give all my time on this project as long as I have help.
